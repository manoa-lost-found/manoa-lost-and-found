## Architecture Overview

For Milestone 1, the focus is on UI and flow, not backend logic.

### Key Conceptual Elements

- **Items** – Lost or Found posts (category, description, location, image, status)  
- **Users** – UH-authenticated members submitting posts  
- **Locations** – Official drop-off/pickup sites  
- **Content** – FAQ, recovery instructions, static pages  

This lightweight model will evolve during future milestones.
